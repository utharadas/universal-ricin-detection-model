# Universal Ricin Detection Model

<table>
<tr>
<td>
Impedance spectroscopy is a process in which a current is run through a mixture in order to detecct the presence of certain molecules an chemical reactions within the sample. Our task was to use machine learning techniques to analyze the impedance spectroscopy data provided by Dr. Takhistov, an associate Food Science Professor  and his team in order to aid the development of a more cost effective way to detect Ricin, a common biotoxin found in many foods. Adter using data scraping and cleaning techniques to complete the data in a usable format, we began various forms of data analysis in order to determine which variables would most clearly show the presence of ricin. Once the dimensionality of the problem had been reduced, we began applying various machine learning techniques including random forests, logistic regression, nd neural networks to train a classification model to determine whether the data from a sample indicated the absence or presence of Ricin.
